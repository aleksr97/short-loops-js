Short Loops
===========

Practice refactoring of loops into shorter code using filter, map reduce and other higher order functions.

The file loops contains functions that use loops to process data. your task is to rewrite them without using loops. Please put your code in a file named `noloops.js`.

If you have finished rewriting all the functions you can run the `npm run test` command to test your functions.
